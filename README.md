ðŸš€ Azure Infrastructure as Code (IaC) with Bicep
This project demonstrates Infrastructure as Code (IaC) using Bicep to deploy a containerized Flask application on Azure with security and monitoring best practices.

Azure Container Registry (ACR) â€“ Stores the Docker container image.

ACR Token with Least Privilege â€“ Secures access to the registry.

Azure Container Instance (ACI) â€“ Runs the Flask app with public access.

âœ… Best Practices Implemented
Public IP â€“ Allows external access to the application.

HTTP on Port 80 â€“ Standard web traffic port.

Azure Monitor Logging â€“ Centralized logging for container diagnostics.
